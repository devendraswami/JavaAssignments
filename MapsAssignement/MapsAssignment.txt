 1. What is Maps? 
    Answer -

     Map is a interface in java. Which is used to store data in key value-pair form. Where each
     key value pair is known as entry. A map contains unique keys. 
     A Map is useful if you have to update or delete elements on the basis of a key. 



     2. What are the most commanly used implementations of map in java? 
     Answer - 

     The most commanly used interface of java are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeSet and ConcurrentHashMap. 


     3. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap? 
     Answer - 

     In HashMap order of insertion is not preserved. It uses Hashing to store key value pair. In TreeMap 
     we will get the data in sorted order. 


     4. How do you check if a key exists in a map in java? 
     Answer - 

     We can check if a key is present using containsKey() or get(). containsKey results in boolean value 
     and get() method will give the value if key is present if not then it will give  null.  


     5. What are generics in java? 
     Answer -
    
     Generics in java introdued in java in 1.5 version. Generics is a feature in java that allows for 
     creation of classes , interfaces and methods that can operate on a variety of data types. 

     It provides compile-time type safety by enabling the specification of the data type of objects that a 
     class or method can work with. 

     Generics are implemented using type parameters which are specified inside angle brackets <> . 


     6. What are the benefits of using genrics in java ? 

     Ans- 

     Some of the benefits of using Generics -
      1.TypeSafety -
       When we use generics it will give us complie time error if while accessing the data type is mismatched
         so that we can change it while creating the program it will not stop the execution of program later. 

      2. code reusablity 
      3. Improved performance 
      

      7. What is Generics class in java? 
      Answer - 

      A generics class in java is a class which can work with different types of data . It is defined using
      parameters enclosed in angle brackets. which defines the data type used. 

      8. What is Type parameter in java Generics? 

      Answer- 

      Generics in java is a single Uppar case letter in angle brackets. used to specify the data type of 
      a class or method . for example - <T> 


      9. What is Generis method in java? 

      Answer- 

      Generics method in java is a method which can work with different data type. It is parameritised in angle 
      brackets. which specify the type of data used . 


      10. What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T> ?
      
      Answer- 

      ArrayList is a non genrics class. It can store any data type. While ArrayList<T> is a generics class 
      it can store only specified data type.
