Ques1  What is Collection FrameWork in java? 

Ans--> 

       Collection Framework is collection of classes and interface which is used to store and manupilate
       the data. The classes are LinkedList, ArrayList, Hashset, LinkedList etc. The interface are List, 
       Queue , set etc.
       
       

Ques2   What is the difference between LinkedList and ArrayList? 

Ans-->  
 
ArrayList --> 
             1. It uses the Dynamic array . 
             2. ArrayList implements list interface .
             3. It will preserve the order of data. 
             4. It provides Random Access . 

             

LinkedList --> 
             1. LinkedList implements List and Deque Interface. 
             2. Behind the scene LinkedList Follows Doubly linkedList Data Structure. 
             3. LinkedList takes more memory as it Object as well as address of the object . 
             4. It doesnot provide Random Access. 


Ques3       What is the Difference Between Iterator and ListIterator? 

Ans-->     

Iterator --> 1. Iterator can fetch the elements only in forword direction. 
             2.  Iterator can be used in List, Queue and set .


ListIterator --> 1. ListIterator can fetch data from both direction. Forward and Backward direction. 
                 2.  ListIterator can be used only in List interface. 



Ques4       What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration? 

Ans-->  Iterator 
                1. Iterator can transvere legecy and non- legecy elements.
                2. Iterator is fail-fast. 
                3. It is slower the Enumeration. 
                
       Enumeration 
                 1. Enumeration can transverce only legecy elements. 
                 2. Enumeration is not Fail- fast. 
                 3. It is faster then Iterator. 


Ques5   What is the difference between List and Set ? 

Ans-->  List and set both implements Collection interface whereas there are somediffernce- 
        1. List can contain duplicate items while set contains unique items. 
        2. List is an ordered Collection which preserve  the insertion order. while set is an unordered 
           collection which do not preserve the insertion order. 
        3. List interface contains a single leagcy class while set interface do not contain any legcy class. 


Ques6 . What is the difference between HashSet and Treeset ? 

Ans-->  Hashset and TreeSet both are the implementation of set interface but there are somedifferece between those
        1. Ordering -  HashSet is an UnOrdered collection. It will not preserve the data order. While TreeSet 
                       is an ordered Collection. it will Store the data in sorted Order. 

       2. Implementation - HastSet implements the HashTable behind the scene while TreeSet implements Binary search 
                           Tree Data Structure. 

       3. Memory - HashSet uses less memory then Tree Set because it only store elements. While TreeSet stores additional information.
        
       4. Usage-  Hashset is good to use if there is no need to preserve the order. Treeset is good if we want 
                  the data in sorted order. 


Ques7  What is the difference between Arrays and ArrayList? 

Ans-->  Both Arrays and ArrayList are used to store the collection of data in java while there are some difference - 
        
1. Type -  Arrays can store Primitive data Types as well as objects . While Array list can store Objects. 

2. Size-    The size of Array is fixed once it is created we can't change the size after intilization. but 
            in arrayList we can change the size after intilization. 

3. Intilization - Arrrays can be intilized While creating . but in Array list we need Methods to intilize. 

4. Speed -  Arrays are fast in nature then ArrayList. 

5. Methods - Arrays have limited methods while ArrayList have a lot of methods.
