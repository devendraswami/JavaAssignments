//  1. What are the conditional Operators in java?

//  When a condition comes of multiple boolean Expression we use conditional Operators , for example
//  we have to print something only if the age of a person is in between 20 and 30 .
//  
           
    //   We have three types of operators -
    //   1. Logical - and Operators(&&)
    //   2. Logical - or Operators(||)
    //   3. Logical - ternary oprerator(? :)
     
// 2. What are the types Of operators based on the number of operands ?
    //  There are two types of Operators basend on the the number of Operands Unary and Binary. Unary 
    //  Operators perform action with single operand and binary operators perform action with two operands.



// 3. What is the use of Switch case in java Programming?

//    The switch case is used to select one of many code blocks for execution . 
   

// 4. What are the priority levels of Arithmatic Operations in java?

// Priority level is Parenthesis > Exponents > Division/Multiplication > Addition/Subtraction > Modulus


// 5. What are conditions statements ? and use of conditions statements in java.

//  Conditional statements are some block of code to decide based on some given condition.	
// 	Their use is to make decision in programming.

// 6. What is the Syntex of if else Statement?

//  Syntex -
//   if(condition)
//   {
//     // code if condition is true 
//   }
// else 
// {
//     // code if condition is false . 
// }



// 7.What are the three types of iterative statements in java?

// Three types of iterative statements java are -
// 1. for loop 
  
// Syntax for for loop - 
// for(intilization   conditioncheck  Update   )
// {
//     Body 
// }

// 2. while loop -

// Syntax for while loop-

//  intilization
//  while(condition)
//  {
//     // code 
//     Update
//  }

// 3. Do while loop
 
//  Syntax- 
  
//  intilization 
//  do 
//  {
//     //code
//  }
// while(condition)



//  8. Write the difference between for loop and do while loop .
 
//  The main differnce between for loop and do while loop is that in for loop the condition is 
//  checked before the execution of the code but in the do while loop the condition is checked
//  after the execution of the code. do while loop will run once if the condition is false.
 

//  9. Write a program to write numbers form 1 to 10.
for(int num = 1; num<11; num++)
{
    System.out.println(num);
} 
   }
