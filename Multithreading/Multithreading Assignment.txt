Question1 What do you mean by Multithreading? Why it is important?

Ans

Multithreading means multiple therads . It is the most important feature of java . By Multithrading we 
can use two or more therads simultaneously to execute the program. Multithreading makes the program 
simple and fast. The main purpose is to excute the multiple thrads simultaneously. It save the time of CPU.

2. What are the benefits of using Multithrading?

Ans - some of the benefits of using Multithrading are below - 

 1. It make the program to run contionously even if a part of it is blocked. 
 2. It save the time of CPU.
 3. Makes the program fast and Easy to execute. 
 4. Improve performance compared to traditional parallel programs that use multiple processes.


 3. What is Thread? 
 
 Ans - Thread is basically lightweight and smallest unit of processing that is manged by thread sheduler.
  It is the line of execution. 



  4. What are the two ways of implementing the thread in java ?

  
  Ans->

  The two ways of implementing  thread in java are- 
  
  1. By implementing the Runnable interface

  class Demo implements Runnable
  {
    public void run()
    {
        System.out.println("My thread is running");
    }

    public void main(String []args)
    {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        Thread tObj = new Thread(obj);
        
        tObj.start();
    }
  }
 
  // output will be my thread is running 

  it is recommend or more effiecent way of implementing because in this child class can have two parent classes. 


  2. By Extending Thread class 

  class Demo extends Thread 
  {
    public void run()
    {
        System.out.println("My thread is running ");
    }

    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.start();
    }
  }

// Output will be my thread is running 



5. What is the difference between Process and Thread?

Ans 

Thread -  It is the smallest unit of processing. It is controlled by thred sheduller.

Process - It simply refers to the program that is currently executing. It is controlled by PCB(Process 
Control Block).


6. How Can we create deamon Threads?

Ans-
 We can create deamon Threads by using Thread class setDeamon(true). It is used to mark the current 
as deamon . isDeamon() method is used to check the current thread is deamon or not. if the thread is 
deamon  then it will result in true otherwise false.


7. What are the wait() and sleep() methods? 

Ans --> 

wait()- It is a non- static method that causes the current thread to wait and go to the sleep until some 
        other threads call the notify. It is defined in the object class and should only called from a 
        synchronized context. 


sleep() --> 

it is a static method that pauses or stops the execution of current thread for specifed time. It is defined 
in the thread class.
