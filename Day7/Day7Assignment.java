1. What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming language?

Ans--> 
       Statically typed - There are some programing languages where when you create some varible 
       need to define the type of data. ie - String = "Devendra swami"; 
       for example java, c++,c 
       
       Dyanamically typed- There are some programming languages where you don't need to define the 
       data type while creating variables. ie name = "Devendra swami";


2. What is the varibles in java?

Ans--> It is the name of memory location . It is a Container that holds the value while the programe
       is executed . Each variable should be given a unique name to indicate the storage area.
  
       


3. How to assign a value to a varaible?

Ans--> Steps to assign a value to a variable-
      
       1. First give the data type.
       2. then give the variable name.
       3. then you can value .
       
       Syntax for Declaring variable- 
        DataType variableName = value;
        
       For example- String name = " Devendra Swami"; 


4. What are the Primitive data types in java?  
 
Ans--> The primitive data type  are predefined data types which  includes byte, short, int , long, float , double, boolean , char . 

 
5. What are the identifiers in java?

Ans--> What ever names you give to a package , class, interface , method or variable are called 
       identifiers . All identifiers must have unique names. 

       for example- class Plane 
                    int age;
                    int cost;
                    String brand;
                    void carryPassanger()


6. List the Operators in java.

Ans--> operators in java are - 
        1. Arthemitic Operators 
        2. Relational Operatos 
        3. logical Operators
        4. Assignment Operators 
        5. Unary Operators
        6. Bitwise Operators


7. Explain about Increament and Decreament Oprators in java and give an example.


Ans-->  
       Increament Operators - 
        
       Increament Operators are different types of Operators used to increase the value of given 
       variable by 1. 

       Syntax for pre increament Operators is " X = ++a; "
       Syntax for post increament Operators is - "x = a++;"

      
       Decreament Operators - 

       Decreament Operators are different types of Operators used to decrease the value of given 
       variable by 1. 

       Syntax for pre decreament operators is - " x = --a;"
       Syntax for post decreament Operators is - " x = a--;"
